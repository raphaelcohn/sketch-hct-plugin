// Color spaces that measure luminance, such as Y in XYZ, L* in L*a*b*, or T in HCT, are known as perceptually accurate color spaces.
//
// To be displayed, they must gamut map to a "display space", one that has a defined limit on the number of colors.
// Display spaces include sRGB, more commonly understood as RGB/HSL/HSV/HSB.
// Gamut mapping is undefined and not defined by the color space.
// Any gamut mapping algorithm must choose how to sacrifice accuracy in hue, saturation, and/or lightness.
//
// A principled solution is to maintain lightness, thus maintaining contrast/a11y, maintain hue, thus maintaining aesthetic intent, and reduce chroma until the color is in gamut.
//
// HCT chooses this solution, but, that doesn't mean it will _exactly_ matched desired lightness, if only because RGB is quantized: RGB is expressed as a set of integers: there may be an RGB color with, for example, 47.892 lightness, but not 47.891.
//
// To allow for this inherent incompatibility between perceptually accurate color spaces and display color spaces, methods that take a contrast ratio and luminance, and return a luminance that reaches that contrast ratio for the input luminance, purposefully darken/lighten their result such that the desired contrast ratio will be reached even if inaccuracy is introduced.
//
// 0.4 is generous, ex. HCT requires much less delta.
// It was chosen because it provides a rough guarantee that as long as a perceptual color space gamut maps lightness such that the resulting lightness rounds to the same as the requested, the desired contrast ratio will be reached.

// HCT Tone.
// Perceptual Luminance.
// Linear scale from 0% to 100%.
// A difference of 40 guarantees a contrast ratio >= 3.0.
// A difference of 50 guarantees a contrast ratio >= 4.5.
